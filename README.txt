This is my collection of class to use Box2D with Flixel.

B2FlxSprite is a FlxSprite with a b2Body atached to it. The shape is a polygon.

B2FlxTileblock is the same thing as B2FlxSprite but with a Tileblock and a static body.

B2Circle is a FlxSprite with a b2Circle shape atached to it instead of a b2Polygon shape.
